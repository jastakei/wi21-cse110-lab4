- num1 = "5"
- num2 = "6"
- result = "56" 
(they are all string data types)

- What was the bug?
  - The bug was that is was concatenating num1 and num2 insetead of adding them as intergers
- How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix.
  - I would parse the strings of num1 and num2 into integers first before adding them to get the correct result. ![here](part3/fix.png)
